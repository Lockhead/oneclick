                This document describes a method for signaling a one-click function for
                the list-unsubscribe email header.  The need for this arises out of the
                actuality that mail software sometimes fetches URLs in mail headers, and
                thereby accidentally triggers unsubcriptions in the case of the
                list-unsubscribe header.

        <section title="Introduction">
            <t>
                An <xref target="RFC2369" /> email header can contain HTTP or HTTPS URIs.  In case of the
                List-Unsubscribe Header the HTTP or HTTPS URI should unsubscribe the
                recipient of the email directly from the list.  But Anti-spam software
                often fetches all resources in mail headers, without any action by the
                message recipient.  In consequence of this unintended malicious
                behavior, senders implement landing pages with a confirmation step to
                finish the unsubscribe request.  This document addresses this part of
                the problem, as it proposes a POST action for receivers that can be
                distinguished by senders from other requests and therefore handled
                independently.  So intended one-click unsubscriptions are still
                possible.

                The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
                "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
                document are to be interpreted as described in BCP14, <xref target="RFC2119" />.

            <t>
                One-click describes an action that directly triggers a change
                in a system's state, intended to be applied only with a user's intent.

            <t>This document has several goals.
                <list style="symbol">
                    <t>
                        Allow email senders to signal "One-Click" functionality for specific
                        HTTP and HTTPS URIs used in <xref target="RFC2369" /> email headers.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        Allow MUA designers to implement independent user interface features for
                        a better user experience.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        Allow MUA users to trigger intended actions in a familiar environment
                        and without leaving the MUA context.
                    </t>
                </list>
            </t>

        <section title="Out of Scope">
            <t>
                This document does not address problems associated with intended
                malicious behavior.
            </t>
        </section>
        <section title="Implementation">
            <section title="Mail senders">
                <t>
                    An entity which is responsible for sending an email, that wishes to add
                    an actionable HTTP or HTTPS URI for one-click unsubscriptions places
                    both a List-Unsubscribe and a List-Unsubscribe-Post header in the
                    message.  The List-Unsubscribe-Post header may contain multiple key
                    value pairs needed by the sending entity, it also must contain the key
                    value pair "List-Unsubscribe=One-Click" to adhere to this specification.
                </t>
                <t>
                    The sending entity needs to provide the infrastructure to handle POST
                    requests to the specified URI in the List-Unsubscribe header.
                </t>
                <t>
                    The "One-Click" action triggered by this URI must complete in an appropriate
                    timeframe and should never burden the requester in an inappropriate way.
                    The sending entity cannot expect that HTTP redirects are followed by the
                    requester.
                </t>
            </section>
            <section title="Mail receivers">
                <t>
                    A receiving entity which wants to use a List-Unsubscribe HTTP URI from
                    an email that also contains a List-Unsubscribe-Post header shall HTTP
                    POST to the first HTTP URI in the List-Unsubscribe header and send the
                    content of the List-Unsubscribe-Post header as request body with the
                    content type set to "application/x-www-form-urlencoded".
                </t>
                <t>
                    The receiving entity shall not request the HTTP URI without user
                    consent.  When and how the user consent is obtained is not part of this
                    specification.
                </t>
                <t>
                    The Request must use the HTTP verb POST, other verbs are not permitted
                    as especially the HEAD and GET requests should never be used in cases
                    where a state change is triggered. PUT and DELETE would offer similar
                    functionality but are often not implemented correctly or are not
                    implemented at all.
                </t>

        <section title="Additional Requirements">
            <t>
                The email needs at least one valid authentication identifier, in this
                version of the specification the only supported identifier type is
                DKIM <xref target="RFC7489" />, that provides a domain-level identifier in the
                content of the "d=" tag of a validated DKIM-Signature header field.
            </t>
            <t>
                The corresponding headers need to be included in the "h=" tag of a
                valid DKIM-Signature header field.
            </t>
            <t>
                The domain used in the HTTP or HTTPS URI shall align to the domain used
                in the <xref target="RFC5322" />.From field or to the domain in the "d=" tag of the valid
                DKIM-Signature header field in which the headers are included in the
                "h=" tag.
